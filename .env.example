# Technical Analysis - Kraken OHLC timeframe for indicators (EMA, RSI)
KRAKEN_OHLC_INTERVAL=240              # 4-hour candles for swing trading
# Available intervals:
#   1 = 1 minute    |  60 = 1 hour
#   5 = 5 minutes   | 240 = 4 hours (recommended for swing)
#  15 = 15 minutes  | 1440 = 1 day
#  30 = 30 minutes  | 10080 = 1 week

# Examples with percentage mode (optimized for small balances):
# PAPER mode ($1000 initial balance):
#   - TRADE_AMOUNT_PERCENT=30 → trades $300 (30% of $1000)
#   - MIN_BALANCE_PERCENT=15 → keeps $150 (15% of $1000) as reserve
#   - Can make 3+ trades with good profit potential
#
# REAL mode ($92 balance - optimized):
#   - TRADE_AMOUNT_PERCENT=30 → trades $27.60 (30% of $92)
#   - MIN_BALANCE_PERCENT=15 → keeps $13.80 (15% of $92) as reserve
#   - Trade size balances risk vs reward vs fees
#   - Expected: +12-15% monthly with swing trading
